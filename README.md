### MyFoodies
MyFoodies is a sample project that illustrates a modern approach to Android app development. It combines popular Android tools to demonstrate best practices, using an up-to-date tech stack. The tech stack includes:

### UI
- Compose declarative UI framework
- Material design

### Tech/Tools
- Kotlin 100% coverage
- Coroutines and Flow for async operations
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Jetpack
    - Compose
    - Navigation for navigation between composables
    - ViewModel that stores, exposes, and manages UI state
- Retrofit for networking
- Coil for image loading

### Modern Architecture
- Single activity architecture (with Navigation component) that defines navigation graphs
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for presentation layer
- Android Architecture components (ViewModel, Navigation)
- Android KTX - Jetpack Kotlin extensions

The app's presentation is structured with the MVVM pattern. It also includes sample animations such as expanding and collapsing row items, along with effects like a collapsing toolbar.
